# HW05 Notes

This week's homework is to do a data visualization of a dataset. 

## Ideation
The dataset I chose is ["2018 Central Park Squirrel Census - Squirrel Data"](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw) from NYC Open Data. Initially, I thought it would be interesting to create a map by visualizing data. Therefore, I browsed through Open Data on AWS, Kaggle, and NYC Open Data to see if there are datasets containing longitude and latitude. Among the datasets, this dataset about squirrels attracted my attention because I like to read about animals. 

There are many columns in the CSV file, including longitude, latitude, squirrel fur color, number of squirrels at the spot, and so on. Therefore, I planned to use the canvas as a map of Central Park and showcase the squirrel data on the canvas. 

## Implementation
