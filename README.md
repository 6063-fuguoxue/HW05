# HW05 Notes

This week's homework is to do a data visualization of a dataset. 

## Ideation
The dataset I chose is ["2018 Central Park Squirrel Census - Squirrel Data"](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw) from NYC Open Data. Initially, I thought it would be interesting to create a map by visualizing data. Therefore, I browsed through Open Data on AWS, Kaggle, and NYC Open Data to see if there are datasets containing longitude and latitude. Among the datasets, this dataset about squirrels attracted my attention because I like to read about animals.
